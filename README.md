## Acknowledgments
This project was a fun opportunity to play around with a physics-based animation library like react-spring, and I was gladly surprised about how nice it can work with another tools that were already part of my development flow, like styled-components. It goes without saying that it was also great to somehow play tribute to an amazing place like Christiania.
